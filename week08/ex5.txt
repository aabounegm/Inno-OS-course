Physical address:
	Refers to addresses that are available in the main memory unit. They physically exist on the real memory.
	It usually contains only the applications currently executing, since memory is not enough to accomodate all programs.
	These addresses are loaded to the memory address register.
	The user cannot access physical addresses. The MMU accesses them through the memory bus.
	Limited by the size of actual memory present.
	
Virtual address:
	Refers to addresses generated by the CPU while executing a program during compile time.
	They get mapped to physical addresses during runtime.
	They are not real memory locations, but rather just an illusion.
	The user can access virtual addresses.
	They can be much bigger than the physical memory available.
