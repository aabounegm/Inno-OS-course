The number specified for the permission is in octal, and the individual bits correspond to the rwx permission for each user type.
For example:
	7 = 111 = rwx
	6 = 110 = rw-
	4 = 100 = r--
	0 = 000 = ---
	where r=read, w=write, and x=execute
The 3 numbers together represent the permission bits for user, group, and owner, respectively.
	 u   g   o
	rwx rwx rwx
